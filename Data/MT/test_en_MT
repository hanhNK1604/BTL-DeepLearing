Jenna McCarthy : What you don &apos;t know about marriage
In this funny , casual talk from TEDx , writer Jenna McCarthy shares surprising research on how marriages really work . One tip : Do not try to win an Oscar for best actress . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
Every year in the United States alone , 2,077,000 couples make a legal and spiritual decision to spend the rest of their lives together ...
and not to have sex with anyone else , ever .
He buys a ring , she buys a dress .
They go shopping for all sorts of things .
She takes him to Arthur Murray for ballroom dancing lessons .
And the big day comes .
And they &apos;ll stand before God and family and some guy her dad once did business with , and they &apos;ll vow that nothing , not abject poverty , not life-threatening illness , not complete and utter misery will ever put the tiniest damper on their eternal love and devotion .
These optimistic young bastards promise to honor and cherish each other through hot flashes and mid-life crises and a cumulative 50-lb. weight gain , until that far-off day when one of them is finally able to rest in peace .
You know , because they can &apos;t hear the snoring anymore .
And then they &apos;ll get stupid drunk and smash cake in each others &apos; faces and do the &quot; Macarena , &quot; and we &apos;ll be there showering them with towels and toasters and drinking their free booze and throwing birdseed at them every single time -- even though we know , statistically , half of them will be divorced within a decade .
Of course , the other half won &apos;t , right ?
They &apos;ll keep forgetting anniversaries and arguing about where to spend holidays and debating which way the toilet paper should come off of the roll .
And some of them will even still be enjoying each others &apos; company when neither of them can chew solid food anymore .
And researchers want to know why .
I mean , look , it doesn &apos;t take a double-blind , placebo-controlled study to figure out what makes a marriage not work .
Disrespect , boredom , too much time on Facebook , having sex with other people .
But you can have the exact opposite of all of those things -- respect , excitement , a broken Internet connection , mind-numbing monogamy -- and the thing still can go to hell in a hand basket .
So what &apos;s going on when it doesn &apos;t ?
What do the folks who make it all the way to side-by-side burial plots have in common ?
What are they doing right ?
What can we learn from them ?
And if you &apos;re still happily sleeping solo , why should you stop what you &apos;re doing and make it your life &apos;s work to find that one special person that you can annoy for the rest of your life ?
Well researchers spend billions of your tax dollars trying to figure that out .
They stalk blissful couples and they study their every move and mannerism .
And they try to pinpoint what it is that sets them apart from their miserable neighbors and friends .
And it turns out , the success stories share a few similarities , actually , beyond they don &apos;t have sex with other people .
For instance , in the happiest marriages , the wife is thinner and better looking than the husband .
Obvious , right .
It &apos;s obvious that this leads to marital bliss because , women , we care a great deal about being thin and good looking , whereas men mostly care about sex ...
ideally with women who are thinner and better looking than they are .
The beauty of this research though is that no one is suggesting that women have to be thin to be happy ; we just have to be thinner than our partners .
So instead of all that laborious dieting and exercising , we just need to wait for them to get fat , maybe bake a few pies .
This is good information to have , and it &apos;s not that complicated .
Research also suggests that the happiest couples are the ones that focus on the positives .
For example , the happy wife .
Instead of pointing out her husband &apos;s growing gut or suggesting he go for a run , she might say , &quot; Wow , honey , thank you for going out of your way to make me relatively thinner . &quot;
These are couples who can find good in any situation .
&quot; Yeah , it was devastating when we lost everything in that fire , but it &apos;s kind of nice sleeping out here under the stars , and it &apos;s a good thing you &apos;ve got all that body fat to keep us warm . &quot;
One of my favorite studies found that the more willing a husband is to do house work , the more attractive his wife will find him .
Because we needed a study to tell us this .
But here &apos;s what &apos;s going on here .
The more attractive she finds him , the more sex they have ; the more sex they have , the nicer he is to her ; the nicer he is to her , the less she nags him about leaving wet towels on the bed -- and ultimately , they live happily ever after .
In other words , men , you might want to pick it up a notch in the domestic department .
Here &apos;s an interesting one .
One study found that people who smile in childhood photographs are less likely to get a divorce .
This is an actual study , and let me clarify .
The researchers were not looking at documented self-reports of childhood happiness or even studying old journals .
The data were based entirely on whether people looked happy in these early pictures .
Now I don &apos;t know how old all of you are , but when I was a kid , your parents took pictures with a special kind of camera that held something called film , and , by God , film was expensive .
They didn &apos;t take 300 shots of you in that rapid-fire digital video mode and then pick out the nicest , smileyest one for the Christmas card .
Oh no .
They dressed you up , they lined you up , and you smiled for the fucking camera like they told you to or you could kiss your birthday party goodbye .
But still , I have a huge pile of fake happy childhood pictures and I &apos;m glad they make me less likely than some people to get a divorce .
So what else can you do to safeguard your marriage ?
Do not win an Oscar for best actress .
I &apos;m serious .
Bettie Davis , Joan Crawford , Hallie Berry , Hillary Swank , Sandra Bullock , Reese Witherspoon , all of them single soon after taking home that statue .
They actually call it the Oscar curse .
It is the marriage kiss of death and something that should be avoided .
And it &apos;s not just successfully starring in films that &apos;s dangerous .
It turns out , merely watching a romantic comedy causes relationship satisfaction to plummet .
Apparently , the bitter realization that maybe it could happen to us , but it obviously hasn &apos;t and it probably never will , makes our lives seem unbearably grim in comparison .
And theoretically , I suppose if we opt for a film where someone gets brutally murdered or dies in a fiery car crash , we are more likely to walk out of that theater feeling like we &apos;ve got it pretty good .
Drinking alcohol , it seems , is bad for your marriage .
Yeah .
I can &apos;t tell you anymore about that one because I stopped reading it at the headline .
But here &apos;s a scary one : Divorce is contagious .
That &apos;s right -- when you have a close couple friend split up , it increases your chances of getting a divorce by 75 percent .
Now I have to say , I don &apos;t get this one at all .
My husband and I have watched quite a few friends divide their assets and then struggle with being our age and single in an age of sexting and Viagra and eHarmony .
And I &apos;m thinking they &apos;ve done more for my marriage than a lifetime of therapy ever could .
So now you may be wondering , why does anyone get married ever ?
Well the U.S. federal government counts more than a thousand legal benefits to being someone &apos;s spouse -- a list that includes visitation rights in jail , but hopefully you &apos;ll never need that one .
But beyond the profound federal perks , married people make more money .
We &apos;re healthier , physically and emotionally .
We produce happier , more stable and more successful kids .
We have more sex than our supposedly swinging single friends -- believe it or not .
We even live longer , which is a pretty compelling argument for marrying someone you like a lot in the first place .
Now if you &apos;re not currently experiencing the joy of the joint tax return , I can &apos;t tell you how to find a chore-loving person of the approximately ideal size and attractiveness who prefers horror movies and doesn &apos;t have a lot of friends hovering on the brink of divorce , but I can only encourage you to try , because the benefits , as I &apos;ve pointed out , are significant .
The bottom line is , whether you &apos;re in it or you &apos;re searching for it , I believe marriage is an institution worth pursuing and protecting .
So I hope you &apos;ll use the information I &apos;ve given you today to weigh your personal strengths against your own risk factors .
For instance , in my marriage , I &apos;d say I &apos;m doing okay .
One the one hand , I have a husband who &apos;s annoyingly lean and incredibly handsome .
So I &apos;m obviously going to need fatten him up .
And like I said , we have those divorced friends who may secretly or subconsciously be trying to break us up .
So we have to keep an eye on that .
And we do like a cocktail or two .
On the other hand , I have the fake happy picture thing .
And also , my husband does a lot around the house , and would happily never see another romantic comedy as long as he lives .
So I &apos;ve got all those things going for me .
But just in case , I plan to work extra hard to not win an Oscar anytime soon .
And for the good of your relationships , I would encourage you to do the same .
I &apos;ll see you at the bar .
John Maeda : How art , technology and design inform creative leaders
John Maeda , former President of the Rhode Island School of Design , delivers a funny and charming talk that spans a lifetime of work in art , design and technology , concluding with a picture of creative leadership in the future . Watch for demos of Maeda &apos;s earliest work -- and even a computer made of people .
I have to say that I &apos;m very glad to be here .
I understand we have over 80 countries here , so that &apos;s a whole new paradigm for me to speak to all of these countries .
In each country , I &apos;m sure you have this thing called the parent-teacher conference .
Do you know about the parent-teacher conference ?
Not the ones for your kids , but the one you had as a child , where your parents come to school and your teacher talks to your parents , and it &apos;s a little bit awkward .
Well , I remember in third grade , I had this moment where my father , who never takes off from work , he &apos;s a classical blue collar , a working-class immigrant person , going to school to see his son , how he &apos;s doing , and the teacher said to him , he said , &quot; You know , John is good at math and art . &quot;
And he kind of nodded , you know ?
The next day I saw him talking to a customer at our tofu store , and he said , &quot; You know , John &apos;s good at math . &quot;
And that always stuck with me all my life .
Why didn &apos;t Dad say art ? Why wasn &apos;t it okay ?
Why ? It became a question my entire life , and that &apos;s all right , because being good at math meant he bought me a computer , and some of you remember this computer , this was my first computer .
Who had an Apple II ? Apple II users , very cool .
As you remember , the Apple II did nothing at all .
You &apos;d plug it in , you &apos;d type in it and green text would come out .
It would say you &apos;re wrong most of the time .
That was the computer we knew .
That computer is a computer that I learned about going to MIT , my father &apos;s dream . And at MIT , however , I learned about the computer at all levels , and after , I went to art school to get away from computers , and I began to think about the computer as more of a spiritual space of thinking .
And I was influenced by performance art -- so this is 20 years ago . I made a computer out of people .
It was called the Human Powered Computer Experiment .
I have a power manager , mouse driver , memory , etc . , and I built this in Kyoto , the old capital of Japan .
It &apos;s a room broken in two halves .
I &apos;ve turned the computer on , and these assistants are placing a giant floppy disk built out of cardboard , and it &apos;s put into the computer .
And the floppy disk drive person wears it .
She finds the first sector on the disk , and takes data off the disk and passes it off to , of course , the bus .
So the bus diligently carries the data into the computer to the memory , to the CPU , the VRAM , etc . , and it &apos;s an actual working computer . That &apos;s a bus , really .
And it looks kind of fast . That &apos;s a mouse driver , where it &apos;s XY .
It looks like it &apos;s happening kind of quickly , but it &apos;s actually a very slow computer , and when I realized how slow this computer was compared to how fast a computer is , it made me wonder about computers and technology in general .
And so I &apos;m going to talk today about four things , really .
The first three things are about how I &apos;ve been curious about technology , design and art , and how they intersect , how they overlap , and also a topic that I &apos;ve taken on since four years ago I became the President of Rhode Island School of Design : leadership .
And I &apos;ll talk about how I &apos;ve looked to combine these four areas into a kind of a synthesis , a kind of experiment .
So starting from technology , technology is a wonderful thing .
When that Apple II came out , it really could do nothing .
It could show text and after we waited a bit , we had these things called images .
Remember when images were first possible with a computer , those gorgeous , full-color images ?
And then after a few years , we got CD-quality sound .
It was incredible . You could listen to sound on the computer .
And then movies , via CD-ROM . It was amazing .
Remember that excitement ?
And then the browser appeared . The browser was great , but the browser was very primitive , very narrow bandwidth .
Text first , then images , we waited , CD-quality sound over the Net , then movies over the Internet . Kind of incredible .
And then the mobile phone occurred , text , images , audio , video . And now we have iPhone , iPad , Android , with text , video , audio , etc .
You see this little pattern here ?
We &apos;re kind of stuck in a loop , perhaps , and this sense of possibility from computing is something I &apos;ve been questioning for the last 10 or so years , and have looked to design , as we understand most things , and to understand design with our technology has been a passion of mine .
And I have a small experiment to give you a quick design lesson .
Designers talk about the relationship between form and content , content and form . Now what does that mean ?
Well , content is the word up there : fear .
It &apos;s a four-letter word . It &apos;s a kind of a bad feeling word , fear .
Fear is set in Light Helvetica , so it &apos;s not too stressful , and if you set it in Ultra Light Helvetica , it &apos;s like , &quot; Oh , fear , who cares ? &quot; Right ?
You take the same Ultra Light Helvetica and make it big , and like , whoa , that hurts . Fear .
So you can see how you change the scale , you change the form . Content is the same , but you feel differently .
You change the typeface to , like , this typeface , and it &apos;s kind of funny . It &apos;s like pirate typeface , like Captain Jack Sparrow typeface . Arr ! Fear !
Like , aww , that &apos;s not fearful . That &apos;s actually funny .
Or fear like this , kind of a nightclub typeface .
Like , we gotta go to Fear .
It &apos;s , like , amazing , right ?
It just changes the same content .
Or you make it -- The letters are separated apart , they &apos;re huddled together like on the deck of the Titanic , and you feel sorry for the letters , like , I feel the fear .
You feel for them .
Or you change the typeface to something like this .
It &apos;s very classy . It &apos;s like that expensive restaurant , Fear .
I can never get in there .
It &apos;s just amazing , Fear . But that &apos;s form , content .
If you just change one letter in that content , you get a much better word , much better content : free .
&quot; Free &quot; is a great word . You can serve it almost any way .
Free bold feels like Mandela free .
It &apos;s like , yes , I can be free .
Free even light feels kind of like , ah , I can breathe in free .
It feels great . Or even free spread out , it &apos;s like , ah , I can breathe in free , so easily .
And I can add in a blue gradient and a dove , and I have , like , Don Draper free .
So you see that -- form , content , design , it works that way .
It &apos;s a powerful thing . It &apos;s like magic , almost , like the magicians we &apos;ve seen at TED . It &apos;s magic .
Design does that .
And I &apos;ve been curious about how design and technology intersect , and I &apos;m going to show you some old work I never really show anymore , to give you a sense of what I used to do .
So -- yeah .
So I made a lot of work in the &apos; 90s .
This was a square that responds to sound .
People ask me why I made that . It &apos;s not clear .
But I thought it &apos;d be neat for the square to respond to me , and my kids were small then , and my kids would play with these things , like , &quot; Aaah , &quot; you know , they would say , &quot; Daddy , aaah , aaah . &quot; You know , like that .
We &apos;d go to a computer store , and they &apos;d do the same thing .
And they &apos;d say , &quot; Daddy , why doesn &apos;t the computer respond to sound ? &quot;
And it was really at the time I was wondering why doesn &apos;t the computer respond to sound ?
So I made this as a kind of an experiment at the time .
And then I spent a lot of time in the space of interactive graphics and things like this , and I stopped doing it because my students at MIT got so much better than myself , so I had to hang up my mouse .
But in &apos; 96 , I made my last piece . It was in black and white , monochrome , fully monochrome , all in integer mathematics .
It &apos;s called &quot; Tap , Type , Write . &quot;
It &apos;s paying a tribute to the wonderful typewriter that my mother used to type on all the time as a legal secretary .
It has 10 variations .
There &apos;s a shift .
Ten variations . This is , like , spin the letter around .
This is , like , a ring of letters .
This is 20 years old , so it &apos;s kind of a -- Let &apos;s see , this is — I love the French film &quot; The Red Balloon . &quot;
Great movie , right ? I love that movie . So , this is sort of like a play on that .
It &apos;s peaceful , like that .
I &apos;ll show this last one . This is about balance , you know .
It &apos;s kind of stressful typing out , so if you type on this keyboard , you can , like , balance it out .
If you hit G , life &apos;s okay , so I always say , &quot; Hit G , and it &apos;s going to be all right .
Thank you .
Thank you .
So that was 20 years ago , and I was always on the periphery of art .
By being President of RISD I &apos;ve gone deep into art , and art is a wonderful thing , fine art , pure art .
You know , when people say , &quot; I don &apos;t get art .
I don &apos;t get it at all . &quot; That means art is working , you know ?
It &apos;s like , art is supposed to be enigmatic , so when you say , like , &quot; I don &apos;t get it , &quot; like , oh , that &apos;s great .
Art does that , because art is about asking questions , questions that may not be answerable .
At RISD , we have this amazing facility called the Edna Lawrence Nature Lab . It has 80,000 samples of animal , bone , mineral , plants .
You know , in Rhode Island , if an animal gets hit on the road , they call us up and we pick it up and stuff it .
And why do we have this facility ?
Because at RISD , you have to look at the actual animal , the object , to understand its volume , to perceive it .
At RISD , you &apos;re not allowed to draw from an image .
And many people ask me , John , couldn &apos;t you just digitize all this ? Make it all digital ? Wouldn &apos;t it be better ?
And I often say , well , there &apos;s something good to how things used to be done . There &apos;s something very different about it , something we should figure out what is good about how we did it , even in this new era .
And I have a good friend , he &apos;s a new media artist named Tota Hasegawa . He &apos;s based in London , no , actually it &apos;s in Tokyo , but when he was based in London , he had a game with his wife . He would go to antique shops , and the game was as such : When we look at an antique we want , we &apos;ll ask the shopkeeper for the story behind the antique , and if it &apos;s a good story , we &apos;ll buy it .
So they &apos;d go to an antique shop , and they &apos;d look at this cup , and they &apos;d say , &quot; Tell us about this cup . &quot;
And the shopkeeper would say , &quot; It &apos;s old . &quot;
&quot; Tell us more . &quot; &quot; Oh , it &apos;s really old . &quot;
And he saw , over and over , the antique &apos;s value was all about it being old .
And as a new media artist , he reflected , and said , you know , I &apos;ve spent my whole career making new media art .
People say , &quot; Wow , your art , what is it ? &quot; It &apos;s new media .
And he realized , it isn &apos;t about old or new .
It &apos;s about something in between .
It isn &apos;t about &quot; old , &quot; the dirt , &quot; new , &quot; the cloud . It &apos;s about what is good .
A combination of the cloud and the dirt is where the action is at .
You see it in all interesting art today , in all interesting businesses today . How we combine those two together to make good is very interesting .
So art makes questions , and leadership is something that is asking a lot of questions .
We aren &apos;t functioning so easily anymore .
We aren &apos;t a simple authoritarian regime anymore .
As an example of authoritarianism , I was in Russia one time traveling in St. Petersburg , at a national monument , and I saw this sign that says , &quot; Do Not Walk On The Grass , &quot; and I thought , oh , I mean , I speak English , and you &apos;re trying to single me out . That &apos;s not fair .
But I found a sign for Russian-speaking people , and it was the best sign ever to say no .
It was like , &quot; No swimming , no hiking , no anything . &quot;
My favorite ones are &quot; no plants . &quot; Why would you bring a plant to a national monument ? I &apos;m not sure .
And also &quot; no love . &quot;
So that is authoritarianism .
And what is that , structurally ?
It &apos;s a hierarchy . We all know that a hierarchy is how we run many systems today , but as we know , it &apos;s been disrupted .
It is now a network instead of a perfect tree .
It &apos;s a heterarchy instead of a hierarchy . And that &apos;s kind of awkward .
And so today , leaders are faced with how to lead differently , I believe .
This is work I did with my colleague Becky Bermont on creative leadership . What can we learn from artists and designers for how to lead ?
Because in many senses , a regular leader loves to avoid mistakes .
Someone who &apos;s creative actually loves to learn from mistakes .
A traditional leader is always wanting to be right , whereas a creative leader hopes to be right .
And this frame is important today , in this complex , ambiguous space , and artists and designers have a lot to teach us , I believe .
And I had a show in London recently where my friends invited me to come to London for four days to sit in a sandbox , and I said great .
And so I sat in a sandbox for four days straight , six hours every day , six-minute appointments with anyone in London , and that was really bad .
But I would listen to people , hear their issues , draw in the sand , try to figure things out , and it was kind of hard to figure out what I was doing .
You know ? It &apos;s all these one-on-one meetings for like four days .
And it felt kind of like being president , actually .
I was like , &quot; Oh , this my job . President . I do a lot of meetings , you know ? &quot;
And by the end of the experience , I realized why I was doing this .
It &apos;s because leaders , what we do is we connect improbable connections and hope something will happen , and in that room I found so many connections between people across all of London , and so leadership , connecting people , is the great question today .
Whether you &apos;re in the hierarchy or the heterarchy , it &apos;s a wonderful design challenge .
And one thing I &apos;ve been doing is doing some research on systems that can combine technology and leadership with an art and design perspective .
Let me show you something I haven &apos;t shown anywhere , actually .
So what this is , is a kind of a sketch , an application sketch I wrote in Python . You know how there &apos;s Photoshop ?
This is called Powershop , and the way it works is imagine an organization . You know , the CEO isn &apos;t ever at the top . The CEO &apos;s at the center of the organization .
There may be different subdivisions in the organization , and you might want to look into different areas . For instance , green are areas doing well , red are areas doing poorly .
You know , how do you , as the leader , scan , connect , make things happen ? So for instance , you might open up a distribution here and find the different subdivisions in there , and know that you know someone in Eco , over here , and these people here are in Eco , the people you might engage with as CEO , people going across the hierarchy .
And part of the challenge of the CEO is to find connections across areas , and so you might look in R &amp; amp ; D , and here you see one person who crosses the two areas of interest , and it &apos;s a person important to engage .
So you might want to , for instance , get a heads-up display on how you &apos;re interacting with them .
How many coffees do you have ?
How often are you calling them , emailing them ?
What is the tenor of their email ? How is it working out ?
Leaders might be able to use these systems to better regulate how they work inside the heterarchy .
You can also imagine using technology like from Luminoso , the guys from Cambridge who were looking at deep text analysis . What is the tenor of your communications ?
So these kind of systems , I believe , are important .
They &apos;re targeted social media systems around leaders .
And I believe that this kind of perspective will only begin to grow as more leaders enter the space of art and design , because art and design lets you think like this , find different systems like this , and I &apos;ve just begun thinking like this , so I &apos;m glad to share that with you .
So in closing , I want to thank all of you for your attention . Thanks very much .
Emiliano Salinas : A civil response to violence
In this passionate talk that &apos;s already caused a sensation in Mexico , Emiliano Salinas , son of former president Carlos Salinas de Gortari , confronts the current climate of violence in Mexico -- or rather , how Mexican society responds to it . He calls on ordinary citizens to move from denial and fear to peaceful , community-based action .
My name is Emiliano Salinas and I &apos;m going to talk about the role we members of society play in the violent atmosphere this country is living in right now .
I was born in 1976 .
I grew up in a traditional Mexican family .
As a child , I had a pretty normal life : I would go to school , play with my friends and cousins .
But then my father became President of Mexico and my life changed .
What I &apos;m about to say , at least some of what I &apos;m about to say , will cause controversy .
Firstly , because I &apos;m the one who &apos;s going to say it .
And secondly , because what I &apos;m going to say is true , and it will make a lot of people nervous because it &apos;s something we don &apos;t want to hear .
But it &apos;s imperative that we listen because it &apos;s undeniable and definitive .
It will also make members of criminal organizations nervous for the same reasons .
I &apos;m going to talk about the role we members of society play in this phenomenon , and about four different response levels we citizens have against violence .
I know many will find it difficult to separate the fact that I &apos;m Carlos Salinas de Gortari &apos;s son from the fact that I &apos;m a citizen concerned about the country &apos;s current situation .
Don &apos;t worry .
It &apos;s not necessary for understanding the importance of what I &apos;m going to say .
I think we have a problem in Mexico .
We have a big problem .
I think there &apos;s consensus on this .
No one argues -- we all agree there &apos;s a problem .
What we don &apos;t agree on is what the problem actually is .
Is it the Zetas ? The drug traffickers ? The government ?
Corruption ? Poverty ? Or is it something else ?
I think none of these is the problem .
I don &apos;t mean they don &apos;t deserve attention .
But we won &apos;t be able to take care of any of those things if we don &apos;t solve the real problem we have in Mexico first .
The real problem we have is most of us Mexicans , we believe we are victims of our circumstances .
We are a country of victims .
Historically , we &apos;ve always acted as victims of something or somebody .
We were victims of the Spaniards .
Then we were victims of the French .
Then we were victims of Don Porfirio .
Then we were victims of the PRI .
Even of Salinas .
And of El Peje .
