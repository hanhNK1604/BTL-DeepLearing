And now of the Zetas and the traffickers and the criminals and the kidnappers ...
Hold on ! Wait a minute !
What if none of these things is the problem ?
The problem is not the things we feel victims of .
The problem is that we play the role of victims .
We need to open our eyes and see that we are not victims .
If only we stopped feeling like victims , if we stopped acting as victims , our country would change so much !
I &apos;m going to talk about how to go from a society that acts as a victim of circumstances to a responsible , involved society that takes the future of its country in its own hands .
I &apos;m going to talk about four different levels of civil response against violence , from weakest to strongest .
The first level , the weakest level of civil response against violence , is denial and apathy .
Today , much of Mexican society is in denial of the situation we &apos;re going through .
We want to go on with our daily life even though we are not living under normal circumstances .
Daily life in our country is , to say the least , under extraordinary , exceptional circumstances .
It &apos;s like someone who has a serious illness and pretends it &apos;s the flu and it will just go away .
We want to pretend that Mexico has the flu .
But it doesn &apos;t .
Mexico has cancer .
And if we don &apos;t do something about it , the cancer will end up killing it .
We need to move Mexican society from denial and apathy to the next level of citizen response , which is , effectively , recognition .
And that recognition will sow fear -- recognizing the seriousness of the situation .
But , fear is better than apathy because fear makes us do something .
Many people in Mexico are afraid today .
We &apos;re very afraid .
And we &apos;re acting out of that fear .
And let me tell you what the problem is with acting out of fear -- and this is the second level of civil response : fear .
Let &apos;s think about Mexican streets : they &apos;re unsafe because of violence , so people stay at home .
Does that make streets more or less safe ?
Less safe !
So streets become more desolate and unsafe , so we stay home more -- which makes streets even more desolate and unsafe , and we stay home even more .
This vicious circle ends up with the whole population stuck inside their houses , scared to death -- even more afraid than when we were out on the streets .
We need to confront this fear .
We need to move Mexican society , the members of society who are at this level , to the next level , which is action .
We need to face our fears and take back our streets , our cities , our neighborhoods .
For many people , acting involves courage .
We go from fear to courage .
They say , &quot; I can &apos;t take it anymore .
Let &apos;s do something about it . &quot;
Recently -- this is a sensitive figure -- 35 public lynchings have been recorded so far in 2010 in Mexico .
Usually it &apos;s one or two a year .
Now we &apos;re experiencing one every week .
This shows that society is desperate and it &apos;s taking the law into its own hands .
Unfortunately , violent action -- though action is better than no action -- but taking part in it only disguises violence .
If I &apos;m violent with you and you respond with violence , you become part of the violence and you just disguise my violence .
So civil action is vital , but it &apos;s also vital to take people who are at the level of courage and violent action to the next level , which is non-violent action .
It &apos;s pacific , coordinated civil action , which doesn &apos;t mean passive action .
It means it &apos;s determined and effective , but not violent .
There are examples of this kind of action in Mexico .
Two years ago , in Galena City , Chihuahua , a member of the community was kidnapped , Eric Le Barón .
His brothers , Benjamín and Julián , got together with the rest of the community to think of the best course of action : to pay the ransom , to take up arms and go after the kidnappers or to ask the government for help .
In the end , Benjamín and Julián decided the best thing they could do was to organize the community and act together .
So what did they do ?
They mobilized the whole community of Le Barón to go to Chihuahua , where they organized a sit-in in the central park of the city .
They sent a message to the kidnappers : &quot; If you want your ransom come and get it .
We &apos;ll be waiting for you right here . &quot;
They stayed there .
Seven days later , Eric was set free and was able to return home .
This is an example of what an organized society can do , a society that acts .
Of course , criminals can respond .
And in this case , they did .
On July 7th , 2009 , Benjamín Le Barón was murdered .
But Julián Le Barón keeps working and he has been mobilizing communities in Chihuahua for over a year .
And for over a year he has known that a price has been put on his head .
But he keeps fighting .
He keeps organizing .
He keeps mobilizing .
These heroic acts are present all over the country .
With a thousand Juliáns working together , Mexico would be a very different country .
And they &apos;re out there !
They just have to raise their hands .
I was born in Mexico , I grew up in Mexico and along the way , I learned to love Mexico .
I think anyone who has stepped foot on this land -- not to mention all Mexican people -- will agree that it &apos;s not difficult to love Mexico .
I &apos;ve traveled a lot and nowhere else have I found the passion Mexicans have .
That devotion we feel for the national football team .
That devotion we show in helping victims of disasters , such as the earthquake in 1985 or this year &apos;s floods .
The passion with which we &apos;ve been singing the national anthem since we were kids .
When we thought Masiosare was the strange enemy , and we sang , with a childlike heart , &quot; a soldier in each son . &quot;
I think the biggest insult , the worst way you can offend a Mexican is to insult their mother .
A mother is the most sacred thing in life .
Mexico is our mother and today she cries out for her children .
We are going through the darkest moment in our recent history .
Our mother , Mexico , is being violated before our very eyes .
What are we going to do ?
Masiosare , the strange enemy , is here .
Where is the soldier in each son ?
Mahatma Gandhi , one of the greatest civil fighters of all time , said , &quot; Be the change you wish to see in the world . &quot;
Today in Mexico we &apos;re asking for Gandhis .
We need Ghandis .
We need men and women who love Mexico and who are willing to take action .
This is a call for every true Mexican to join this initiative .
This is a call so that every single thing we love about Mexico -- the festivals , the markets , the restaurants , the cantinas , the tequila , the mariachis , the serenades , the posadas , El Grito , the Day of the Dead , San Miguel , the joy , the passion for life , the fight and everything it means to be Mexican -- doesn &apos;t disappear from this world .
We &apos;re facing a very powerful opponent .
But we are many more .
They can take a man &apos;s life .
Anyone can kill me , or you , or you .
But no one can kill the spirit of true Mexicans .
The battle is won , but we still have to fight it .
2000 years ago , the Roman poet Juvenal said something that today echoes in the heart of every true Mexican .
He said , &quot; Count it the greatest sin to prefer life to honor , and for the sake of living to lose what makes life worth living . &quot;
Thank you .
Evelyn Glennie : How to truly listen
In this soaring demonstration , deaf percussionist Evelyn Glennie illustrates how listening to music involves much more than simply letting sound waves hit your eardrums .
I &apos;m not quite sure whether I really want to see a snare drum at nine o &apos;clock or so in the morning .
But anyway , it &apos;s just great to see such a full theater , and really I must thank Herbie Hancock and his colleagues for such a great presentation .
One of the interesting things , of course , is the combination of that raw hand on the instrument and technology , and of course what he said about listening to our young people .
Of course , my job is all about listening , and my aim , really , is to teach the world to listen .
That &apos;s my only real aim in life .
And it sounds quite simple , but actually it &apos;s quite a big , big job .
Because you know , when you look at a piece of music -- for example , if I just open my little motorbike bag -- we have here , hopefully , a piece of music that is full of little black dots on the page .
And , you know , we open it up and I read the music .
So technically , I can actually read this .
I will follow the instructions , the tempo markings , the dynamics .
I will do exactly as I &apos;m told .
And so therefore , because time is short , if I just play you literally the first maybe two lines or so . It &apos;s very straightforward .
There &apos;s nothing too difficult about the piece .
But here I &apos;m being told that the piece of music is very quick .
I &apos;m being told where to play on the drum .
I &apos;m being told which part of the stick to use .
And I &apos;m being told the dynamic .
And I &apos;m also being told that the drum is without snares .
Snares on , snares off .
So therefore , if I translate this piece of music , we have this idea .
And so on . My career would probably last about five years .
However , what I have to do as a musician is do everything that is not on the music .
Everything that there isn &apos;t time to learn from a teacher , or to talk about , even , from a teacher .
But it &apos;s the things that you notice when you &apos;re not actually with your instrument that in fact become so interesting , and that you want to explore through this tiny , tiny surface of a drum .
So there , we experience the translation . Now we &apos;ll experience the interpretation .
Now my career may last a little longer !
But in a way , you know , it &apos;s the same if I look at you and I see a nice bright young lady with a pink top on .
I see that you &apos;re clutching a teddy bear , etc . , etc .
So I get a basic idea as to what you might be about , what you might like , what you might do as a profession , etc . , etc .
However , that &apos;s just , you know , the initial idea I may have that we all get when we actually look , and we try to interpret , but actually it &apos;s so unbelievably shallow .
In the same way , I look at the music ; I get a basic idea ; I wonder what technically might be hard , or , you know , what I want to do .
Just the basic feeling .
However , that is simply not enough .
And I think what Herbie said -- please listen , listen .
We have to listen to ourselves , first of all .
If I play , for example , holding the stick -- where literally I do not let go of the stick -- you &apos;ll experience quite a lot of shock coming up through the arm .
And you feel really quite -- believe it or not -- detached from the instrument and from the stick , even though I &apos;m actually holding the stick quite tightly .
By holding it tightly , I feel strangely more detached .
If I just simply let go and allow my hand , my arm , to be more of a support system , suddenly I have more dynamic with less effort . Much more .
And I just feel , at last , one with the stick and one with the drum .
And I &apos;m doing far , far less .
So in the same way that I need time with this instrument , I need time with people in order to interpret them .
Not just translate them , but interpret them .
If , for example , I play just a few bars of a piece of music for which I think of myself as a technician -- that is , someone who is basically a percussion player ...
And so on . If I think of myself as a musician ...
And so on . There is a little bit of a difference there that is worth just -- -- thinking about .
And I remember when I was 12 years old , and I started playing tympani and percussion , and my teacher said , &quot; Well , how are we going to do this ? You know , music is about listening . &quot;
And I said , &quot; Yes , I agree with that . So what &apos;s the problem ? &quot;
And he said , &quot; Well , how are you going to hear this ? How are you going to hear that ? &quot;
And I said , &quot; Well , how do you hear it ? &quot;
He said , &quot; Well , I think I hear it through here . &quot;
And I said , &quot; Well , I think I do too -- but I also hear it through my hands , through my arms , cheekbones , my scalp , my tummy , my chest , my legs and so on . &quot;
And so we began our lessons every single time tuning drums -- in particular , the kettle drums , or tympani -- to such a narrow pitch interval , so something like ...
that of a difference . Then gradually ... and gradually ...
and it &apos;s amazing that when you do open your body up , and open your hand up to allow the vibration to come through , that in fact the tiny , tiny difference ...
can be felt with just the tiniest part of your finger , there .
And so what we would do is that I would put my hands on the wall of the music room , and together we would &quot; listen &quot; to the sounds of the instruments , and really try to connect with those sounds far , far more broadly than simply depending on the ear .
Because of course , the ear is , I mean , subject to all sorts of things .
The room we happen to be in , the amplification , the quality of the instrument , the type of sticks ... etc . , etc .
They &apos;re all different .
Same amount of weight , but different sound colors .
And that &apos;s basically what we are . We &apos;re just human beings , but we all have our own little sound colors , as it were , that make up these extraordinary personalities and characters and interests and things .
And as I grew older , I then auditioned for the Royal Academy of Music in London , and they said , &quot; Well , no , we won &apos;t accept you , because we haven &apos;t a clue , you know , of the future of a so-called &apos; deaf &apos; musician . &quot;
And I just couldn &apos;t quite accept that .
And so therefore , I said to them , &quot; Well , look , if you refuse -- if you refuse me through those reasons , as opposed to the ability to perform and to understand and love the art of creating sound -- then we have to think very , very hard about the people you do actually accept . &quot;
And as a result -- once we got over a little hurdle , and having to audition twice -- they accepted me . And not only that -- what had happened was that it changed the whole role of the music institutions throughout the United Kingdom .
Under no circumstances were they to refuse any application whatsoever on the basis of whether someone had no arms , no legs -- they could still perhaps play a wind instrument if it was supported on a stand .
No circumstances at all were used to refuse any entry .
And every single entry had to be listened to , experienced and then based on the musical ability -- then that person could either enter or not .
So therefore , this in turn meant that there was an extremely interesting bunch of students who arrived in these various music institutions .
And I have to say , many of them now in the professional orchestras throughout the world .
The interesting thing about this as well , though -- -- is quite simply that not only were people connected with sound -- which is basically all of us , and we well know that music really is our daily medicine .
I say &quot; music , &quot; but actually I mean &quot; sound . &quot;
Because you know , some of the extraordinary things I &apos;ve experienced as a musician , when you may have a 15-year-old lad who has got the most incredible challenges , who may not be able to control his movements , who may be deaf , who may be blind , etc . , etc . -- suddenly , if that young lad sits close to this instrument , and perhaps even lies underneath the marimba , and you play something that &apos;s so incredibly organ-like , almost -- I don &apos;t really have the right sticks , perhaps -- but something like this . Let me change .
Something that &apos;s so unbelievably simple -- but he would be experiencing something that I wouldn &apos;t be , because I &apos;m on top of the sound .
I have the sound coming this way .
He would have the sound coming through the resonators .
If there were no resonators on here , we would have ...
So he would have a fullness of sound that those of you in the front few rows wouldn &apos;t experience , those of you in the back few rows wouldn &apos;t experience either .
Every single one of us , depending on where we &apos;re sitting , will experience this sound quite , quite differently .
And of course , being the participator of the sound , and that is starting from the idea of what type of sound I want to produce -- for example , this sound .
Can you hear anything ?
Exactly . Because I &apos;m not even touching it .
But yet , we get the sensation of something happening .
In the same way that when I see tree moves , then I imagine that tree making a rustling sound .
Do you see what I mean ?
Whatever the eye sees , then there &apos;s always sound happening .
So there &apos;s always , always that huge -- I mean , just this kaleidoscope of things to draw from .
So all of my performances are based on entirely what I experience , and not by learning a piece of music , putting on someone else &apos;s interpretation of it , buying all the CDs possible of that particular piece of music , and so on and so forth .
Because that isn &apos;t giving me enough of something that is so raw and so basic , and something that I can fully experience the journey of .
So it may be that , in certain halls , this dynamic may well work .
It may be that in other halls , they &apos;re simply not going to experience that at all and so therefore , my level of soft , gentle playing may have to be ...
Do you see what I mean ? So , because of this explosion in access to sound , especially through the deaf community , this has not only affected how music institutions , how schools for the deaf treat sound -- and not just as a means of therapy -- although of course , being a participator of music , that definitely is the case as well .
But it &apos;s meant that acousticians have had to really think about the types of halls they put together . There are so few halls in this world that actually have very good acoustics , dare I say . But by that I mean where you can absolutely do anything you imagine .
The tiniest , softest , softest sound to something that is so broad , so huge , so incredible ! There &apos;s always something -- it may sound good up there , may not be so good there .
May be great there , but terrible up there .
Maybe terrible over there , but not too bad there , etc . , etc .
So to find an actual hall is incredible -- for which you can play exactly what you imagine , without it being cosmetically enhanced .
And so therefore , acousticians are actually in conversation with people who are hearing impaired , and who are participators of sound .
And this is quite interesting .
I cannot , you know , give you any detail as far as what is actually happening with those halls , but it &apos;s just the fact that they are going to a group of people for whom so many years we &apos;ve been saying , &quot; Well , how on Earth can they experience music ? You know , they &apos;re deaf . &quot;
We just -- we go like that , and we imagine that that &apos;s what deafness is about .
Or we go like that , and we imagine that &apos;s what blindness is about .
If we see someone in a wheelchair , we assume they cannot walk .
It may be that they can walk three , four , five steps . That , to them , means they can walk .
In a year &apos;s time , it could be two extra steps .
In another year &apos;s time , three extra steps .
Those are hugely important aspects to think about .
So when we do listen to each other , it &apos;s unbelievably important for us to really test our listening skills , to really use our bodies as a resonating chamber , to stop the judgment .
For me , as a musician who deals with 99 percent of new music , it &apos;s very easy for me to say , &quot; Oh yes , I like that piece .
Oh no , I don &apos;t like that piece . &quot; And so on .
And you know , I just find that I have to give those pieces of music real time .
It may be that the chemistry isn &apos;t quite right between myself and that particular piece of music , but that doesn &apos;t mean I have the right to say it &apos;s a bad piece of music .
And you know , it &apos;s just one of the great things about being a musician , is that it is so unbelievably fluid .
So there are no rules , no right , no wrong , this way , that way .
If I asked you to clap -- maybe I can do this .
If I can just say , &quot; Please clap and create the sound of thunder . &quot;
I &apos;m assuming we &apos;ve all experienced thunder .
Now , I don &apos;t mean just the sound ; I mean really listen to that thunder within yourselves .
And please try to create that through your clapping . Try . Just -- please try .
Very good ! Snow . Snow . Have you ever heard snow ?
Audience : No .
Evelyn Glennie : Well then , stop clapping . Try again .
Try again . Snow .
See , you &apos;re awake .
Rain . Not bad . Not bad .
You know , the interesting thing here , though , is that I asked a group of kids not so long ago exactly the same question .
Now -- great imagination , thank you very much .
However , not one of you got out of your seats to think , &quot; Right ! How can I clap ? OK , maybe ...
Maybe I can use my jewelry to create extra sounds .
Maybe I can use the other parts of my body to create extra sounds . &quot;
Not a single one of you thought about clapping in a slightly different way other than sitting in your seats there and using two hands .
In the same way that when we listen to music , we assume that it &apos;s all being fed through here .
This is how we experience music . Of course it &apos;s not .
We experience thunder -- thunder , thunder . Think , think , think .
Listen , listen , listen . Now -- what can we do with thunder ?
I remember my teacher . When I first started , my very first lesson , I was all prepared with sticks , ready to go .
And instead of him saying , &quot; OK , Evelyn , please , feet slightly apart , arms at a more-or-less 90 degree angle , sticks in a more-or-less V shape , keep this amount of space here , etc .
Please keep your back straight , etc . , etc . , etc . &quot; -- where I was probably just going to end up absolutely rigid , frozen , and I would not be able to strike the drum , because I was thinking of so many other things -- he said , &quot; Evelyn , take this drum away for seven days , and I &apos;ll see you next week . &quot;
So , heavens ! What was I to do ? I no longer required the sticks ; I wasn &apos;t allowed to have these sticks .
I had to basically look at this particular drum , see how it was made , what these little lugs did , what the snares did .
Turned it upside down , experimented with the shell , experimented with the head .
Experimented with my body , experimented with jewelry , experimented with all sorts of things .
And of course , I returned with all sorts of bruises and things like that -- but nevertheless , it was such an unbelievable experience , because then , where on Earth are you going to experience that in a piece of music ?
Where on Earth are you going to experience that in a study book ?
So we never , ever dealt with actual study books .
So for example , one of the things that we learn when we are dealing with being a percussion player , as opposed to a musician , is basically straightforward single stroke rolls .
Like that . And then we get a little faster and a little faster and a little faster .
And so on and so forth . What does this piece require ?
Single stroke rolls . So why can &apos;t I then do that whilst learning a piece of music ?
And that &apos;s exactly what he did .
And interestingly , the older I became , and when I became a full-time student at a so called &quot; music institution , &quot; all of that went out of the window .
We had to study from study books .
And constantly , the question , &quot; Well , why ? Why ? What is this relating to ?
I need to play a piece of music . &quot; &quot; Oh , well , this will help your control ! &quot;
&quot; Well , how ? Why do I need to learn that ? I need to relate it to a piece of music .
You know . I need to say something .
&quot; Why am I practicing paradiddles ?
Is it just literally for control , for hand-stick control ? Why am I doing that ?
I need to have the reason , and the reason has to be by saying something through the music . &quot;
And by saying something through music , which basically is sound , we then can reach all sorts of things to all sorts of people .
But I don &apos;t want to take responsibility of your emotional baggage .
That &apos;s up to you , when you walk through a hall .
Because that then determines what and how we listen to certain things .
I may feel sorrowful , or happy , or exhilarated , or angry when I play certain pieces of music , but I &apos;m not necessarily wanting you to feel exactly the same thing .
So please , the next time you go to a concert , just allow your body to open up , allow your body to be this resonating chamber .
Be aware that you &apos;re not going to experience the same thing as the performer is .
The performer is in the worst possible position for the actual sound , because they &apos;re hearing the contact of the stick on the drum , or the mallet on the bit of wood , or the bow on the string , etc . , or the breath that &apos;s creating the sound from wind and brass .
They &apos;re experiencing that rawness there .
But yet they &apos;re experiencing something so unbelievably pure , which is before the sound is actually happening .
Please take note of the life of the sound after the actual initial strike , or breath , is being pulled . Just experience the whole journey of that sound in the same way that I wished I &apos;d experienced the whole journey of this particular conference , rather than just arriving last night .
But I hope maybe we can share one or two things as the day progresses .
But thank you very much for having me !
Adam Sadowsky : How to engineer a viral music video
The band OK Go dreamed up the idea of a massive Rube Goldberg machine for their next music video -- and Adam Sadowsky &apos;s team was charged with building it . He tells the story of the effort and engineering behind their labyrinthine creation that quickly became the YouTube sensation &quot; This Too Shall Pass . &quot; &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
Hi there .
I &apos;m going to be talking a little bit about music , machines and life .
Or , more specifically , what we learned from the creation of a very large and complicated machine for a music video .
Some of you may recognize this image .
This is the opening frame of the video that we created .
We &apos;ll be showing the video at the end , but before we do , I want to talk a little bit about what it is that they wanted .
Now , when we first started talking to OK Go -- the name of the song is &quot; This Too Shall Pass &quot; -- we were really excited because they expressed interest in building a machine that they could dance with .
And we were very excited about this because , of course , they have a history of dancing with machines .
They &apos;re responsible for this video , &quot; Here It Goes Again . &quot;
50-million-plus views on YouTube .
Four guys dancing on treadmills , no cuts , just a static camera .
A fantastically viral and wonderful video .
So we were really excited about working with them .
And we sort of started talking about what it is that they wanted .
And they explained that they wanted kind of a Rube Goldberg machine .
Now , for those of you who don &apos;t know , a Rube Goldberg machine is a complicated contraption , an incredibly over-engineered piece of machinery that accomplishes a relatively simple task .
So we were excited by this idea , and we started talking about exactly what it would look like .
And we came up with some parameters , because , you know , building a Rube Goldberg machine has limitations , but it also is pretty wide open .
And we wanted to make sure that we did something that would work for a music video .
So we came up with a list of requirements , the &quot; 10 commandments , &quot; and they were , in order of ascending difficulty : The first is &quot; No magic . &quot;
Everything that happened on screen had to be very easily understood by a typical viewer .
The rule of thumb was that , if my mother couldn &apos;t understand it , then we couldn &apos;t use it in the video .
They wanted band integration , that is , the machine acting upon the band members , specifically not the other way around .
They wanted the machine action to follow the song feeling .
