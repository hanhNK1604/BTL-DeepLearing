shrewd and effective film 
in the world devastated by war , famine and poverty and documented the cruelty and suffering he has found with an devastating , eloquent clarity 
a dream 
life that 's very different from our own and yet instantly recognizable 
it does elect to head off in its own direction

there are many definitions of ` time waster ' but 
this flat effort 
no special effects , and no hollywood endings 
across as darkly funny , energetic , and surprisingly gentle 
to fuse at least three dull plots into one good one

the gentle comic treatment

filled with more holes than clyde barrow 's car . 
a poignant comedy 
of animated filmmaking since old walt 
intolerable levels 
bombastic self-glorification 
the film 's desire to be liked sometimes undermines the possibility for an exploration of the thornier aspects of the nature/nurture argument in regards to homosexuality . 
one problem with the movie , directed by joel schumacher 
much about the film is loopy and ludicrous ... that it could have been a hoot in a bad-movie way if the laborious pacing and endless exposition had been tightened .

the pathology it pretends to investigate 
the thrown-together feel of a summer-camp talent show : hastily written

there 's got to be a more graceful way of portraying the devastation of this disease . 
is a discreet moan of despair about entrapment in the maze of modern life . 
quite funny 
emotionally grand 
the powerpuff girls arrive on the big screen with their super-powers , their super-simple animation and their super-dooper-adorability intact . 
with an unflappable '50s dignity somewhere between jane wyman and june cleaver 
jumble that 's not scary , not smart and not engaging

for all of us 
... broad streaks of common sense emerge with unimpeachable clarity . 
never feels derivative 
slow and ponderous , but rohmer 's drama builds to an intense indoor drama about compassion , sacrifice , and christian love in the face of political corruption

coppola , along with his sister , sofia , is a real filmmaker

the ridiculous bolero 
anyone who ever fantasized about space travel but ca n't afford the $ 20 million ticket to ride a russian rocket should catch this imax offering .

great material 
rumor , a muddled drama about coming to terms with death , 
what really sets the film apart is debrauwer 's refusal to push the easy emotional buttons 
this is the kind of movie that you only need to watch for about thirty seconds before you say to yourself , ` ah , yes , here 
( soderbergh ) tends to place most of the psychological and philosophical material in italics rather than trust an audience 's intelligence , and he creates an overall sense of brusqueness 
its leaden acting , 
sharp edges and a deep vein of sadness run through its otherwise comic narrative . 
begin to tell you how tedious , how resolutely unamusing , how thoroughly unrewarding all of this is , and what a reckless squandering of four fine acting talents

i have not been this disappointed by a movie in a long time . 
the obnoxious special effects , the obligatory outbursts of flatulence and the incessant , so-five-minutes-ago pop music on the soundtrack overwhelm what is left of the scruffy , dopey old hanna-barbera charm . 
childhood innocence 
has many of the things that made the first one charming 
too ludicrous and 
be the end of the world 
derivative , overlong , and bombastic -- 
more simply intrusive 
like a bad improvisation exercise , the superficially written characters ramble on tediously about their lives , loves and the art

the new insomnia is a surprisingly faithful remake of its chilly predecessor , and when it does elect to head off in its own direction , it employs changes that fit it well rather than ones that were imposed for the sake of commercial sensibilities

it 's a funny no-brainer 
those prone to indignation need not apply 
it is a failure .

the film is ... determined to treat its characters , weak and strong , as fallible human beings , not caricatures , and to carefully delineate the cost of the inevitable conflicts between human urges and an institution concerned with self-preservation . 
of artificial suspense 
into a rustic , realistic , and altogether creepy tale of hidden invasion 
tiresomely simpleminded

shreve 's graceful dual narrative gets clunky on the screen , and we keep getting torn away from the compelling historical tale to a less-compelling soap opera .
