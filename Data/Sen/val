while somewhat less than it might have been , the film is a good one , 
filled with strange and wonderful creatures 
can not engage 
... a guiltless film for nice evening out . 
most important and exhilarating 
a fine idea 
its writer-director 's 
marvelously entertaining 
seems uncertain whether it wants to be an acidic all-male all about eve or a lush , swooning melodrama in the intermezzo strain .

nothing new

a minor treat 
the heart of the film 
fairly revealing 
have all the suspense of a 20-car pileup , while the plot holes are big enough for a train car to drive through -- if kaos had n't blown them all up 
shrewd and effective film 
in the world devastated by war , famine and poverty and documented the cruelty and suffering he has found with an devastating , eloquent clarity 
a dream 
life that 's very different from our own and yet instantly recognizable 
it does elect to head off in its own direction 
that a good video game movie is going to show up soon 
there are many definitions of ` time waster ' but 
this flat effort 
no special effects , and no hollywood endings 
across as darkly funny , energetic , and surprisingly gentle 
to fuse at least three dull plots into one good one 
to its superior cast 
about this latest reincarnation of the world 's greatest teacher 
subject as monstrous and pathetic as dahmer 
the gentle comic treatment 
's never as solid 
you get the impression that writer and director burr steers knows the territory ... but his sense of humor has yet to lose the smug self-satisfaction usually associated with the better private schools . 
hate it . 
recognize any of the signposts , as if discovering a way through to the bitter end 
filled with more holes than clyde barrow 's car . 
a poignant comedy 
of animated filmmaking since old walt 
intolerable levels 
bombastic self-glorification 
the film 's desire to be liked sometimes undermines the possibility for an exploration of the thornier aspects of the nature/nurture argument in regards to homosexuality . 
one problem with the movie , directed by joel schumacher 
much about the film is loopy and ludicrous ... that it could have been a hoot in a bad-movie way if the laborious pacing and endless exposition had been tightened . 
intriguing and downright intoxicating

swooning elegance 
wonderful but

sharp , amusing study

kung pow sets a new benchmark for lameness .

morton deserves an oscar nomination . 
has the right stuff for silly summer entertainment and has enough laughs to sustain interest to the end . 
can not overcome the sense that pumpkin is a mere plot pawn for two directors with far less endearing disabilities . 
the pathology it pretends to investigate 
the thrown-together feel of a summer-camp talent show : hastily written 
rage 
there 's got to be a more graceful way of portraying the devastation of this disease . 
is a discreet moan of despair about entrapment in the maze of modern life . 
quite funny 
emotionally grand 
the powerpuff girls arrive on the big screen with their super-powers , their super-simple animation and their super-dooper-adorability intact . 
with an unflappable '50s dignity somewhere between jane wyman and june cleaver 
jumble that 's not scary , not smart and not engaging 
jaglom 's self-conscious and gratingly irritating films 
that takes too long to shake 
the folly of superficiality 
the film has the uncanny ability to right itself precisely when you think it 's in danger of going wrong . 
talented performers 
cinematic car wreck 
underlines even the dullest tangents 
eric schweig and graham greene both exude an air of dignity that 's perfect for the proud warrior that still lingers in the souls of these characters . 
gritty police thriller 
schlocky horror/action hybrid

afraid to show this movie to reviewers before its opening , afraid of the bad reviews they thought they 'd earn 
without sacrificing the integrity of the opera 
mind crappy movies as much as adults , 
weirdness 
is that it 's shot on digital video , whose tiny camera enables shafer to navigate spaces both large ... and small ... with considerable aplomb 
for all of us 
... broad streaks of common sense emerge with unimpeachable clarity . 
never feels derivative 
slow and ponderous , but rohmer 's drama builds to an intense indoor drama about compassion , sacrifice , and christian love in the face of political corruption 
rude 
, the sum of all fears generates little narrative momentum , and invites unflattering comparisons to other installments in the ryan series . 
make great marching bands

the casting of von sydow ... is itself intacto 's luckiest stroke . 
ambition 
not morally bankrupt , at least terribly monotonous 
a bit exploitative but also nicely done , morally alert and street-smart 
is the stuff that disney movies are made of . 
the issues are presented in such a lousy way , complete with some of the year 's ( unintentionally ) funniest moments , that it 's impossible to care . 
it revigorates the mind to see a feature that concentrates on people , a project in which the script and characters hold sway .

it is hard to conceive anyone else in their roles .

welsh whimsy 
of the pushiness and decibel volume of most contemporary comedies 
a must for fans of british cinema , if only because so many titans of the industry are along for the ride .

coppola , along with his sister , sofia , is a real filmmaker 
is the best little `` horror '' movie i 've seen in years 
a compassionate , moving portrait of an american ( and an america ) always reaching for something just outside his grasp 
rude and 
looks more like a travel-agency video targeted at people who like to ride bikes topless and roll in the mud than a worthwhile glimpse of independent-community guiding lights . 
make a gorgeous pair

the ridiculous bolero 
anyone who ever fantasized about space travel but ca n't afford the $ 20 million ticket to ride a russian rocket should catch this imax offering . 
you 're a fan of the series

kooky and overeager

great material 
rumor , a muddled drama about coming to terms with death , 
what really sets the film apart is debrauwer 's refusal to push the easy emotional buttons 
this is the kind of movie that you only need to watch for about thirty seconds before you say to yourself , ` ah , yes , here 
( soderbergh ) tends to place most of the psychological and philosophical material in italics rather than trust an audience 's intelligence , and he creates an overall sense of brusqueness 
its leaden acting , 
sharp edges and a deep vein of sadness run through its otherwise comic narrative . 
begin to tell you how tedious , how resolutely unamusing , how thoroughly unrewarding all of this is , and what a reckless squandering of four fine acting talents 
a smart , steamy mix of road movie , coming-of-age story and political satire . 
thought i heard a mysterious voice , and felt myself powerfully drawn toward the light -- the light of the exit sign . 
all the hallmarks of a movie 
jaw-dropping action sequences , striking villains

it is also elevated by it -- the kind of movie that you enjoy more because you 're one of the lucky few who sought it out . 
seems too simple and the working out of the plot almost arbitrary .

people who have never picked a lock do so easily after a few tries and become expert fighters after a few weeks 
inspirational love story 
is that it progresses in such a low-key manner that it risks monotony . 
super-dooper-adorability 
that one viewing ca n't possibly be enough 
runs through a remarkable amount of material in the film 's short 90 minutes 
the ridiculous dialog 
for something as splendid-looking as this particular film 
metropolis is a feast for the eyes . 
bielinsky is a filmmaker of impressive talent . 
it 's a long way from orwell 's dark , intelligent warning cry ( 1984 ) to the empty stud knockabout of equilibrium

i have not been this disappointed by a movie in a long time . 
the obnoxious special effects , the obligatory outbursts of flatulence and the incessant , so-five-minutes-ago pop music on the soundtrack overwhelm what is left of the scruffy , dopey old hanna-barbera charm . 
childhood innocence 
has many of the things that made the first one charming 
too ludicrous and 
be the end of the world 
derivative , overlong , and bombastic -- 
more simply intrusive 
like a bad improvisation exercise , the superficially written characters ramble on tediously about their lives , loves and the art 
with the inherent absurdity of ganesh 's rise 
the new insomnia is a surprisingly faithful remake of its chilly predecessor , and when it does elect to head off in its own direction , it employs changes that fit it well rather than ones that were imposed for the sake of commercial sensibilities

disgusted 
the film 's messages of tolerance and diversity are n't particularly original , but one ca n't help but be drawn in by the sympathetic characters .

it 's very beavis and butthead , yet always seems to elicit a chuckle . 
than the screenplay , which lags badly in the middle and lurches between not-very-funny comedy , unconvincing dramatics and some last-minute action strongly reminiscent of run lola run 
the film never recovers from the clumsy clich√© of the ugly american abroad , 
too predictable and far too cliched 
it 's a funny no-brainer 
those prone to indignation need not apply 
it is a failure . 
absorbing 
, here 's a fun one . 
the film is ... determined to treat its characters , weak and strong , as fallible human beings , not caricatures , and to carefully delineate the cost of the inevitable conflicts between human urges and an institution concerned with self-preservation . 
of artificial suspense 
into a rustic , realistic , and altogether creepy tale of hidden invasion 
tiresomely simpleminded 
formulaic and stilted 
love , longing , 
, beyond the astute direction of cardoso and beautifully detailed performances by all of the actors , is a note of defiance over social dictates . 
too much power , not enough puff .

shreve 's graceful dual narrative gets clunky on the screen , and we keep getting torn away from the compelling historical tale to a less-compelling soap opera .
