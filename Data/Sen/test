touching 
own breezy , distracted rhythms 
i loved the look of this film . 
shines on all the characters 
his sly , intricate magic 
if not a home run , then at least a solid base hit . 
digital photography 
that trademark grin of his -- so perfect for a ballplayer 
talented , charismatic and tragically 
contrived , awkward and filled with unintended laughs 
lagging near the finish line 
, passionate 
laced with liberal doses of dark humor , gorgeous exterior photography , and a stable-full of solid performances , no such thing is a fascinating little tale . 
also wanted a little alien as a friend ! 
some good material in their story about a retail clerk wanting more out of life 
ice-t sticks his mug in the window of the couple 's bmw and begins haranguing the wife in bad stage dialogue 
nonetheless appreciates the art and reveals a music scene that transcends culture and race . 
any stylish sizzle 
formulaic equations 
as plain and pedestrian as catsup 
hogwash 
it has made its way into your very bloodstream 
fails to do justice to either effort in three hours of screen time 
stretched out to feature length 
ferrara 's 
it look as though they are having so much fun 
should jolt you out of your seat a couple of times , give you a few laughs , and leave you feeling like it was worth your seven bucks , even though it does turn out to be a bit of a cheat in the end 
sophomoric 
scratching your head than hiding under your seat 
with cheapo animation ( like saturday morning tv in the '60s ) , a complex sword-and-sorcery plot and characters who all have big round eyes and japanese names . 
comedy and 
full of nuance and character dimension 
deserved all the hearts it won -- and wins still , 
, whimsical feature 
is his best film yet 
are undermined by the movie 's presentation , which is way too stagy 
dislikable 
is essentially devoid of interesting characters or even a halfway intriguing plot 
it would be easy for critics to shred it 
charming and witty , it 's also somewhat clumsy . 
punctuated by flying guts 
is contrived , unmotivated , and psychologically unpersuasive , with an inconclusive ending . 
'm giving it thumbs down due to the endlessly repetitive scenes of embarrassment . 
unsatisfying ending 
curious about each other against all odds 
queen of the damned as you might have guessed , makes sorry use of aaliyah in her one and only starring role -- 
well-acted , well-directed and , for all its moodiness , not too pretentious . 
refuses to let slackers be seen as just another teen movie , which means he can be forgiven for frequently pandering to fans of the gross-out comedy 
originality ai n't on the menu , but there 's never a dull moment in the giant spider invasion comic chiller 
satin rouge is not a new , or inventive , journey 
lacks it 
an essentially awkward version 
as kooky and overeager as it is spooky and subtly in love with myth 
suspense or believable tension 
despite downplaying her good looks , carries a little too much ai n't - she-cute baggage into her lead role as a troubled and determined homicide cop to quite pull off the heavy stuff . 
enough to let you bask in your own cleverness as you figure it out 
speaks volumes , offering up a hallucinatory dreamscape that frustrates and captivates . 
would be a toss-up between presiding over the end of cinema as we know it and another night of delightful hand shadows . 
intriguing look 
this film is too busy hitting all of its assigned marks to take on any life of its own . 
it 's dark but has wonderfully funny moments ; you care about the characters ; and the action and special effects are first-rate 
exactly what it wants to be : an atrociously , mind-numbingly , indescribably bad movie 
visually striking and 
dumb gags , anatomical humor , or character cliches 
the power of the huston performance , which seems so larger than life and yet so fragile 
jackie chan movies are a guilty pleasure - 
without in any way demeaning its subjects 
's insecure in lovely and amazing , a poignant and wryly amusing film about mothers , daughters and their relationships 
the art direction is often exquisite 
it 's lost the politics and the social observation and become just another situation romance about a couple of saps stuck in an inarticulate screenplay . 
does n't pummel us with phony imagery or music 
highly recommended as an engrossing story about a horrifying historical event and the elements which contributed to it . 
bad ideas and awkwardness 
the film has some of the best special effects ever 
his beautiful , self-satisfied 22-year-old girlfriend and an equally beautiful , self-satisfied 18-year-old mistress 
of cliches that the talented cast generally 
has a wooden delivery and 
conduct in a low , smoky and inviting sizzle 
make gangster no. 1 a worthwhile moviegoing experience 
the acting is fine but the script is about as interesting as a recording of conversations at the wal-mart checkout line 
never amount to a satisfying complete picture of this particular , anciently demanding métier 
how about surprising us by trying something new ? 
does a solid job of slowly 
the lively intelligence of the artists and their perceptiveness about their own situations 
enhancing

there may have been a good film in `` trouble every day , '' but it is not what is on the screen . 
makes their project so interesting 
wonderful on the big screen 
artistic 
's hard to like a film so cold and dead 
gross romanticization 
is a treat . 
defend himself 
a long , dull procession of despair , set to cello music 
spied with my little eye ... a mediocre collection of cookie-cutter action scenes 
beautiful , self-satisfied 
, a walk to remember is an inspirational love story , capturing the innocence and idealism of that first encounter . 
is too much like a fragment of an underdone potato . 
to fulfill its own ambitious goals 
imaginative flight 
a low-budget series on a uhf channel 
emotionally and narratively complex filmmaking 
's coherent , well shot , and tartly 
the entire point of a shaggy dog story , of course , is that it goes nowhere , and 
between deadpan comedy and heartbreaking 
with such good humor 
off the element of surprise 
weighted down with slow , uninvolving storytelling and flat acting . 
is a winning comedy that excites the imagination and tickles the funny bone . 
everyone thinks poo-poo jokes are ` edgy 
's hard to imagine acting that could be any flatter 
of under-inspired , overblown enterprise that gives hollywood sequels a bad name 
that lifts blue crush into one of the summer 's most pleasurable movies 
innovations and glimpse 
the film was immensely enjoyable thanks to great performances by both steve buscemi and rosario dawson ... 
of inspired humor 
worthy of the gong .

point and purpose 
you feel what they feel 
wilco is a phenomenal band with such an engrossing story that will capture the minds and hearts of many . 
of the worst of the entire franchise 
it 's difficult to imagine that a more confused , less interesting and more sloppily made film could possibly come down the road in 2002 . 
for most of the characters 
a nice , light treat 
's enough to watch huppert scheming , with her small , intelligent eyes as steady as any noir villain , and to enjoy the perfectly pitched web of tension that chabrol spins . 
the characters never seem to match the power of their surroundings . 
's worth taking the kids to . 
a superb performance 
reinvigorated 
i like about men with brooms and what is kind of special 
like shrek , spirit 's visual imagination reminds you of why animation is such a perfect medium for children , because of the way it allows the mind to enter and accept another world . 
by the dispassionate gantz brothers as ordinary , pasty lumpen 
it aimlessly and unsuccessfully attempts to fuse at least three dull plots into one good one . 
delivers 
's awfully entertaining to watch . 
uncreative 
rank as three of the most multilayered and sympathetic female characters of the year 
to the tongue-in-cheek attitude of the screenplay 
manages to generate the belly laughs of lowbrow comedy without sacrificing its high-minded appeal . 
most deceptively amusing 
an intimacy that sucks you in and dares you not to believe it 
nonchalantly freaky and uncommonly pleasurable 
endless scenic shots that make 105 minutes seem twice as long 
making this gorgeous film a must for everyone from junior scientists to grown-up fish lovers 
with the rat-a-tat energy of `` his girl friday , '' maintaining a light touch while tackling serious themes 
wheedling reluctant witnesses 
the whole mess boils down to a transparently hypocritical work that feels as though it 's trying to set the women 's liberation movement back 20 years . ' 
often intense 
a knockout 
features nonsensical and laughable plotting , wooden performances , ineptly directed action sequences and some of the worst dialogue in recent memory . 
a complete moron 
in this film , every shot enhances the excellent performances 
sign a pact to burn the negative and the script and pretend the whole thing never existed 
it is essentially empty 
would 've been nice if the screenwriters had trusted audiences to understand a complex story , and left off the film 's predictable denouement . 
muted freak-out

about the human need for monsters to blame for all that 
must for fans of british cinema , if only because so many titans of the industry are along for the ride 
takes a classic story , casts attractive and talented actors

an absorbing and unsettling psychological drama . 
hate yourself for giving in

loneliness and is n't afraid to provoke introspection in both its characters and its audience 
what sets ms. birot 's film apart from others in the genre is a greater attention to the parents -- and particularly the fateful fathers -- in the emotional evolution of the two bewitched adolescents . 
sad nonsense , 
it 's coherent , well shot , and tartly acted , but 
too sappy 
a sweet-tempered comedy that forgoes the knee-jerk misogyny that passes for humor in so many teenage comedies . 
a scrooge or two 
which somewhat dilutes the pleasure of watching them 
marvelous documentary touches -- ever so gracefully -- on the entire history of the yiddish theater , both in america and israel 
incredibly layered and stylistic 
might not seem like the proper cup of tea 
seems more tacky and reprehensible , manipulating our collective fear without bestowing the subject with the intelligence or sincerity it unequivocally deserves . 
does n't figure in the present hollywood program 
as long on the irrelevant as on the engaging , which gradually turns what time is it there ? 
many different ideas from happiness 
this is n't even a movie we can enjoy as mild escapism ; it is one in which fear and frustration are provoked to intolerable levels .
